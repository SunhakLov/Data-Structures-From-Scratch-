# Data Structures From Scratch

This project contains fundamental data structures implemented manually in c++, without using built-in classes. 
The goal is to understand how each structure works behind the scenes and strengthen core programming and problem-solving skills.
I build this to practice for my final exam for Data Structured and Algorithms class. 

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

- âœ… `MyArrayList` â€“ A dynamic array that resizes as needed  
- âœ… `MyLinkedList` â€“ A singly linked list implementation  
- âœ… `MyStack` â€“ Stack built using a linked list (LIFO)  
- âœ… `MyQueue` â€“ Queue built using a linked list (FIFO)  
- âœ… `MyHashMap` â€“ A basic hash map using separate chaining  

Thank you for checking this out !!!
