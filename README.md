# Data Structures From Scratch

This project contains fundamental data structures implemented manually in c++, without using built-in classes. 
The goal is to understand how each structure works behind the scenes and strengthen core programming and problem-solving skills.
I build this to practice for my final exam for Data Structured and Algorithms class.
