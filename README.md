# Data Structures From Scratch

This project contains fundamental data structures implemented manually in c++, without using built-in classes. 
The goal is to understand how each structure works behind the scenes and strengthen core programming and problem-solving skills.
I build this to practice for my final exam for Data Structured and Algorithms class. 

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

- âœ… `Doubly Linked Lists`  
- âœ… `Linked List`
- âœ… `Queues` 
- âœ… `Stacks` 
- âœ… `Tree`

## ðŸ“˜ What I learn

- âœ… Implement basic DSA for Linked List
- âœ… Implement basic DSA for Queues
- âœ… Implement basic DSA for Stacks
- âœ… Implement basic DSA for Trees

Thank you for checking this out !!!
